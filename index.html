            <h3>Software Developer</h3>
            <p class="design">Airtel X Labs, June 2019 - Present</p>
            <p class="desc">
              Ever since I joined Airtel, I have been working in a team called
              Growth. The goal of the team is to increase app activity and
              active app users. Some of the projects that I've been working are
              as follows:
            </p>
            <ul class="desc-notes">
              <li>
                <strong>Referral Engine &mdash;</strong> Built an application on
                the web-view of Airtel App where a user can send invite to a
                non-app user and both of them get reward for successful sign-up.
                Used ES to fetch and validate the activity of user, web-view was
                built in ReactJS and backend in Java Spring boot. This increased
                the number of app sign-ups by 10% everyday.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Airtel Rewards &mdash;</strong> There are many user
                activities on the app like recharge, game play, profile update.
                There are many users who do not have their regular recharges
                using Airtel app and use a third-party application to recharge.
                In order incentivise the user who recharge the app we have
                started started distributing rewards to users for their
                activities.
                <br />
                Built the backend for reward distribution. All the events were
                captured from kafka and then business validations are done and
                coupons are distributed to user. We distribute around 100,000
                coupons everyday.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Airtel Weekends &mdash;</strong> A gaming platform is
                bade for users to play and enjoy games on weekends and they are
                rewarded in case they win the end up winning the game.
                <br />
                Built the backend and front-end for one of the game, spin the
                wheel.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Coupon Distribution &mdash;</strong> To distribute telco
                coupons and show all the coupons for users a separate page was
                built in native react where users can use and manage their telco
                coupons.
                <br />
                Built the front-end for the page in react native
